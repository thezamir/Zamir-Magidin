# 👋 Hi, I'm Zamir Magidin

**AI Consultant | CV, ML & Multi-Agent Systems**  
**Data Science–driven | Python, PyTorch | From business problems to ML solutions**

---

## 🧩 What I Do
I help teams and founders turn **unclear, data-heavy business problems** into **working AI systems**.

My work sits at the intersection of **business consulting**, **data science**, and **applied AI** — translating real operational and strategic needs into measurable, deployable solutions.

---

## 🧠 Background & Perspective
Before focusing fully on AI, I worked as a **business consultant**, supporting decision-makers with:
- problem framing under uncertainty  
- data-driven analysis  
- translating strategy into execution  

That experience strongly shapes how I build AI systems today:  
**clear objectives, realistic constraints, and solutions that actually get used.**

---

## 🛠 How I Work
- Start from the **business question**, not the model  
- Define success through **metrics, constraints, and trade-offs**  
- Build **end-to-end pipelines** (data → model → evaluation → inference)  
- Favor **clarity, robustness, and handover-ready systems**  

---

## 🤖 Multi-Agent & RAG Systems
Design and implementation of **agent-based AI systems**, including:
- Retrieval agents over technical and operational documents  
- Scoring and validation agents to reduce hallucinations  
- Structured answer generation with source control  

Used for **technical knowledge bases**, internal tools, and decision-support systems.

## 📂 Selected Work

### 🧠 Medical Imaging – Computer Vision Case Study
**Kaggle competition | Severe class imbalance**

First published project focusing on a **medical imaging classification problem** with a highly imbalanced dataset — a common real-world challenge in healthcare and risk-sensitive domains.

**Problem**
- Binary classification with extreme class imbalance  
- High cost of false negatives  
- Limited positive samples  

**Approach**
- Classical CNN baseline for fast iteration and signal validation  
- U-Net–based architecture to improve feature extraction under data scarcity  
- Careful train/validation split and metric selection suited for imbalance  
- Data augmentation and sampling strategies aligned with medical constraints  

**Focus**
- Model behavior under imbalance  
- Recall–precision trade-offs  
- Practical evaluation over leaderboard optimization  

This project is treated as a **technical case study**, emphasizing decision-making, constraints, and measurable improvements rather than competition ranking.

More projects will be added incrementally as complete, real-world case studies.

## 🎯 Typical Engagements
- Prototyping and validating AI ideas  
- Improving underperforming ML models  
- Designing document-based RAG systems  
- Translating business requirements into ML pipelines  
- Reviewing data science strategy and evaluation practices
